# Common-T App Concept
## Introduction
Hi, So I have been learning Next.js for the last month or so, with it comes the need to also be very good at react and handling server side processing. 
So this project as is of now is a simple app to be able to use a 3D model in a project. I got to learn the use of a gld and setting certain motion capabilities to the projet. Working with 3D models is fun. I guess the only real work comes in learning how to create the motions, how to use and apply Three.Js and how ro use framer motion to manipulate to motion of elements in your project. I also got to learn the use of valtio to store some react state variables that can be accessed globally thooughout the project and manipulated at will. 
There still definitely is the use of Tailwind Css to style our project and the use of the custom styles with the help of @apply to get thing declutered in the individual project and to allow reusing of data.
I was unable to apply the AI functionality in the project due to the hustle of having to pay for an API key. But am sure this is a hadle I am going to be crossing over very sooon. 
This are hence  some of the few technologiev I have gotten to use here. But I will give a better indepth look at it once I have had a chance to review my code.
